With this blog we are going to have a really cool conversation about refactoring. I'm not an expert in the subject but I'm really interested to always improve my code and make it better constantly.

Refactoring is a process of improving your code and not creating new functionalities.
Clean Code = Simple Code

It means, Clean Code:

Passes all tests;
Is obvious;
Does not contain duplication;
Contains a minimum number of classes and other moving parts.
